After setting up your project, if for example you try to enter a non-existant path such as:

127.0.0.1.8000/home

you recieve a page which is very detailed as it is made for developers

To set your own page follow the steps below:

1. Turn debug to false

Open the settings.py file in myproject and change DEBUG value to False
Add '*' inside allowed hosts(with the quotes!) to include all possible hosts.


A new page should appear when you refresh the page
