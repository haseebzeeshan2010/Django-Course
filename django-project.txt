After setting up the virtual environment

Install django using:

pip install django


Create a project and give it a name:

django-admin startproject <nameofproject>

Then enter the project using:

cd <nameofproject>


Create the app and give it a name:

django-admin startapp <appname>

NOTE: This also creates a file called manage.py that works like the django-admin command




---------------Run the Development Server------------------

python3 manage.py runserver


NOTE: the Development server is not recommended to be used in production as it has not gone through security auditing or performance tests

(another) NOTE: The Development server automatically reloads the python code for each request so you don't need to restart the server for each change.
However some actions like creating files don't trigger the server reset so you need to do it yourself.
